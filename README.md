i. create a readable file that has a total of 100 words. The program should start by 
counting all the words in a given file and display the output i.e. there are 100 words 
in this file.

ii. The program will pick any 20 words from a file add the words to array and apply a 
sorting algorithm in ascending or descending order and perform the following
functions;
a. Write the 20 sorted words to a file, 
b. A words are to be stored in an array and sorted using a bubble sort.
c. A sorted list of words will be saved to a file, and displayed to the user to view

iii. The user should be able to enter a word and be able to search for the word in sorted 
array.

iv. Implement your program with a GUI

v. Your programming method should be Object Oriented i.e. good programming 
practices such as separation of classes that performs tasks of sorting words from 
classes that runs your code.

vi. Apply OO principles such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism and 
encapsulation

vii. Provide test cases for your program and show sample input/output outcome
